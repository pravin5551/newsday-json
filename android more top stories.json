I became its first president and chief executive."},{"type":"text","text":"The organization was modeled after the highly successful New York City Housing Partnership. We soon learned, however, that doing affordable housing on Long Island was vastly different from doing it in New York City. A principal reason was Long Island’s 13 towns, two cities and 95 villages, each with its own land-use policies, culture, and personalities. The Long Island Housing Partnership had to adjust to Long Island if we were to get anything done. Likewise, Gov. Kathy Hochul needs to adjust her housing proposal if it is going to have any success on Long Island."},{"type":"text","text":"The governor is right to address the Island’s housing crisis and do so as an economic sustainability issue. Housing has been the third rail for Long Island politicians. The governor should be praised for not being afraid to touch it. But if her compact is to have tangible results, she must understand the Island and be open to change."},{"type":"ad","pos":"as1"},{"type":"text","text":"For example, Hochul’s zoning proposal would require increased density a half-mile around train stations. Long Island would be divided into four tiers with mandated densities as high as 50 homes an acre in the tier closest to the city line. The desire to accelerate production is understandable because, with precious few exceptions, as-of-right multifamily zoning doesn’t exist on Long Island. But Hochul's plan treats all communities of the same tier as the same without any regard for existing land uses."},{"type":"text","text":"In Tier 1, Oceanside is different from Westbury and in Tier 3 Sayville is different from Ronkonkoma. The arbitrary half-mile radius lands in the middle of residential neighborhoods in some places; in others, it's underwater. The new rezoning requirement should be limited to parcels already zoned commercial or industrial, or Hochul should increase the infrastructure pot from $250 million to $800 million to encourage rezoning residential parcels. Importantly, because aesthetically pleasing density is always a function of design, architecture compatible with existing locales should be required."},{"type":"text","text":"Equally understandable is the idea of an appointed board that could overrule a municipality’s zoning denial, in a region where approving one affordable housing development — Matinecock Court in East Northport — took nearly a half-century. But an authority should not treat every municipality the same. Massachusetts’ 1969 Chapter 40 (B), the granddaddy of all such superseding authorities, was designed to create affordable homes. It does not treat all towns and cities the same. For example, if 10% or more of a municipality's existing housing stock qualifies as affordable, it is exempt from 40 (B). The statue withstood a referendum in 2010 and was retained with a 58% voter approval. It is still controversial, and it continues to create affordable homes."},{"type":"text","text":"Additional aspects of the governor’s bold proposal could be better adjusted to Long Island. Expediting land-use review, while necessary, will only work with allowances for a municipality’s existing land uses. Increasing income eligibility to live in homes aided by low-income housing tax credits shows Hochul understands the suburbs, but those incomes should be high enough for beginning teachers and nurses to qualify but not so high that landlords can charge market rents and call them affordable."},{"type":"signup-widget","text":"<aside><div class=\"newsletterSignup\"><h3>Sign up for the Morning Update newsletter</h3><p>From breaking news to special features, the Newsday team is covering the issues that matter to you.</p><form id=\"subscribeForm\" name=\"subscribeForm\" action=\"https://www.newsday.com/api/newsletters/signup\" method=\"POST\"><div class=\"formBorder\"><input class=\"form-control\" type=\"email\" name=\"userContact\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Email address\" required=\"required\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"list\" value=\"ND_edit_newsday_now_masterlist\" /></div><input class=\"btn\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\" /></form><p class=\"disclaimer\">By clicking Sign up, you agree to our <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/privacy\" target=\"blank\">privacy policy</a>.</p></div></aside>"},{"type":"text","text":"Back in 1988, few thought housing was a major challenge.

Luckily, the world’s leading expert on bialys lives and works right here on Long Island: Warren Bell, the second-generation owner and president of Bell’s Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside, which he characterized as “the biggest wholesale bialy manufacturer in the world … also, to my knowledge, the <em>only</em> wholesale bialy manufacturer in the world.”"},{"type":"text","text":"Having grown up in the 75-year-old business, Warren has the explanation down pat: “A bialy is a cross between a bagel and an English muffin. It’s softer than a bagel, not so sweet, not so big, not so shiny.”"},{"type":"ad","pos":"as1"},{"type":"text","text":"Warren’s son, Jared, the company’s vice president, picked up the thread: Whereas bagels are traditionally boiled before they are baked — that’s what gives them their glossy crusts — bialys are not; their textural complexity comes from a central dimple that is filled with chopped onion."},{"type":"text","text":"Bell’s produces more than 250,000 bialys a week, selling them to bagel wholesalers and directly to bagel shops that don’t make their own. They supply major supermarkets so if you’ve bought a fresh bialy from the bakery at ShopRite or Stop & Shop, it’s probably been Bell’s; in the freezer section, you’ll find Bell’s bialys sold under the Ray’s New York label. The factory has no official retail shop, but if you stop by during business hours (8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day but Sunday) you can buy bialys by the dozen, as well as that nearly extinct species called the pletzel , a flat LP-sized bialy whose surface is almost obscured by seeds."},{"type":"subhead-big","text":"FROM BAGEL TO BIALY"},{"type":"text","text":"In the late 1800s, Jewish immigrants from the Polish city of Bialystok brought these distinctive yeast rolls to New York; the name was short for “Bialystoker kuchen,” cakes from Bialystok. Originally, a bakery would make either bagels or bialys — there were even separate trade unions for the bakers. Kossar’s, founded in 1936 on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, is the country’s oldest bialy shop. It eventually added bagels to the mix, just as many bagels stores started making bialys. But both breads were handmade fresh every day."},{"type":"text","text":"Then, said Warren, “Lender’s changed everything.” Starting in the '60s and continuing through the 80s, the New Haven-based bakery revolutionized the bagel business, automating the process and selling the bagels to supermarkets both fresh and frozen. The requirements of both mass production and mass-market tastes changed the bagel."},{"type":"text","text":"“They got sweet,” he said, “they got so puffed up you can’t get a finger through.” The “real, old-fashioned bagel,” he explained, “you couldn’t produce it in large volume, you couldn’t ship it. And then people get used to this other thing. Now you are selling bagels to people who grew up with Lender’s.”"},{"type":"signup-widget","text":"<aside><div class=\"newsletterSignup\"><h3>Sign up for the Morning Update newsletter</h3><p>From breaking news to special features, the Newsday team is covering the issues that matter to you.</p><form id=\"subscribeForm\" name=\"subscribeForm\" action=\"https://www.newsday.com/api/newsletters/signup\" method=\"POST\"><div class=\"formBorder\"><input class=\"form-control\" type=\"email\" name=\"userContact\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Email address\" required=\"required\"><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"list\" value=\"ND_edit_newsday_now_masterlist\" /></div><input class=\"btn\" type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign up\" /></form><p class=\"disclaimer\">By clicking Sign up, you agree to our <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/privacy\" target=\"blank\">privacy policy</a>.</p></div></aside>"},{"type":"image","image_path":"https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZjA1MmU3ZTgtN2VhZS00:NDZlZjFk/landscape/768","credit":"Credit: Linda Rosier","caption":" Bialys at Bell’s Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside."},{"type":"text","text":"But a bialy … a bialy requires that human touch. “It’s what we call ‘pulling,’ when you stretch the dough to make that little depression that holds the onion. It has to be done by hand.” He can back up this claim: Jared still kids his father about the time in the 90s when he spent an unspecified amount of money on a pulling machine that fell flat."},{"type":"text","text":"Warren concedes that “bialys will never have the market penetration that bagels do.” And Bell’s profits from machine-made bagels too, selling even more of them than bialys. There are machines involved in their production of bialys, but what you see on the factory floor is the kind of automation you might have seen at the dawn of the industrial revolution: lots of wheels and belts and people covered with flour — not a computer, let alone a robot, in sight."},{"type":"ad","pos":"bs2"},{"type":"subhead-big","text":"HOW TO MAKE BIALYS"},{"type":"text","text":"When Bell’s takes delivery of flour, it goes into an indoor silo that holds almost 100,000 pounds. Pipes on the ceiling draw the flour, 500 pounds of it at a time, into a mixer that kneads it for seven minutes with water, salt and yeast — the same ingredients used for pizza. The finished dough is hand fed into a machine that rolls it into small balls (no one knows why they are called “tagels ”) that get dropped onto wooden boards."},{"type":"text","text":"Bialy dough is quite wet (65% hydration) and it is showered with flour so it doesn’t stick to the innards of the machine; the boards are liberally sprinkled with cornmeal so the tagels don’t stick. Both measures bestow a distinctive powdery, matte surface to the finished bialy. The dough balls go into a warm, humid proofing box (to rise) and emerge ready to become bialys."},{"type":"collage","title":"","link":"https://www.newsday.com/json/lifestyle/restaurants/-hvx15m4c?device=androidtablet-4","image_path":false,"gallerysize":3,"caption":" Left: Bialys are made at Bell’s Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside.

The puller picks up each risen tagel and gently but firmly stretches it out, using thumbs to thin out the center but also to stabilize it so it doesn’t tear. It goes onto a moving conveyor belt and, immediately, the schmearer drops a little splotch of freshly chopped onion into the center, reinforcing the depression. It takes three to six months to become a puller; the schmearer’s job requires less dexterity, but must be quick enough to keep up with the puller."},{"type":"text","text":"Next comes the bialys’ journey into the tunnel oven, 700 degrees on top, 600 on the bottom. Three minutes and 15 feet later they emerge as fully formed bialys, golden brown and with a light but resilient crumb. After they cool to room temperature, they are sorted and packaged according to their ultimate destinations."},{"type":"subhead-big","text":"FROM BROOKLYN TO OCEANSIDE"},{"type":"text","text":"The 32,000-square-foot factory is a far cry from Bell’s roots. In 1948, Warren’s father, Martin, was unable to recover a loan he made to a bialy maker and so he took over the business, B & S Bialy, located in a basement in Borough Park, Brooklyn. Martin and his team worked in their underwear, the coal oven burned so hot. And coal was so expensive, he would periodically go to the Brooklyn Navy yard to supplement the coal with any discarded wooden pallets he could find."},{"type":"ad","pos":"bs3"},{"type":"image","image_path":"https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MzEzNWI0ZDAtNWU2MC00:Y2JhYWQ5/landscape/768","credit":"Credit: Linda Rosier","caption":" Warren Bell, looks at a family photo album at Bell’s Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside."},{"type":"text","text":"In 1954, Martin “came upstairs,” establishing a proper shop in the neighborhood and, 10 years later, he moved B & S to Canarsie, selling his own bialys and bagels he bought in from another shop. In 1972, by which time young Warren had joined the business, he started making his own bagels and renamed the shop Bell’s Bagels & Bialys . In 1996, the company moved again to a larger facility in Canarsie that was supposed to be wholesale only until, Warren recalls, “people started pounding on the door demanding to buy bialys.”"},{"type":"text","text":"Needing even more space, the company, which was now wholesaling bagels as well, moved to its present location in Oceanside in 2016. Martin died in 2004, around the same time that 10-year-old Jared started working. When he was 19, he decided he wanted to come on board full time but his father said no: he knew his smart and hardworking son could make more money and work fewer hours if he “got an education and became a professional.”"},{"type":"text","text":"Jared came up with a foolproof plan: He threatened to join the army knowing his mother would forbid it and, shortly thereafter, he settled into a desk right next to his father’s. In that office, surrounded by sports memorabilia and decades worth of framed articles and citations, they oversee the business, along with Warren’s son-in-law Aaron, the quality assurance manager."},{"type":"subhead-big","text":"THE FUTURE OF BIALYS"},{"type":"text","text":"While Warren is still deeply involved in sales, Jared, now 30, takes on more responsibility, managing the books, the website, social media, product design and spearheading new products such bialys flavored with jalapeño and Asiago cheese. He is also determined to bring Bell’s bialy roll to a wider audience and it certainly deserves one: Made from the same dough but with no depression, the everything-seeded roll is perfect for accommodating burgers and sandwiches."},{"type":"text","text":"Still, the heart of the business remains the classic bialy and, despite himself, Warren is proud that Jared’s involvement ensures that it will be preserved for generations to come. “The idea that we brought the bialy to this level,” he said, “that we are making a product that almost no one makes anymore — it’s an awesome responsibility.”"}],"duration":165568,"related-video":{"headline":"Watch how bialys are made at Bell's Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside","link":"https://bcbolt446c5271-a.akamaihd.net/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/2014288409001/86bdcfb0-e55d-407d-b3aa-c7f4a610e5bb/a15b24d9-fa15-4e67-b77b-bebd9aee0dc2/main.mp4?akamai_token=exp=1708442257~acl=/media/v1/pmp4/static/clear/2014288409001/86bdcfb0-e55d-407d-b3aa-c7f4a610e5bb/a15b24d9-fa15-4e67-b77b-bebd9aee0dc2/main.mp4*~hmac=f0bb20f9cb2bacaa46291670ac34a73b09e4ae30260902527c07f71b275471e9","downloadable":"true","preroll":"true","loop":"false","brightCoveRefId":"onecms:4fa8dda9-b5c6-4bff-a312-c9875f6f4d49","brightcove_id":"6318986619112","shareLink":"https://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/restaurants/bells-brooklyn-bagels-bialys-oceanside-vfo27tso","caption":" Newsday's Erica Marcus stopped by Bell’s Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside to see how a bialy is made.  Credit: Linda Rosier","pagedata":{"pagename":"watch how bialys are made at bell's brooklyn bagels & bialys in oceanside - newsday:things to do:feedme","server":"newsday ace","contenttype":"video","hier":"newsday:things to do:feedme","title":"watch how bialys are made at bell's brooklyn bagels & bialys in oceanside","categories":"restaurants,top video,feedme,androidtablet","source":"newsday","contentid":"NDNmYTliMTMtYzI0OC00","section":"feedme","contentlevel1":"things to do","contentlevel2":"feedme","contentlevel3":"feedme","contentlevel4":"feedme","setblocked":"metered","author":"linda rosier","pubdate":"2023-02-20"}},"image":{"type":"image","image_path":"https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZWY5YjM3MDgtYzRjYS00:MTE2ZDk1/preview/768","image_path_large":"https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZWY5YjM3MDgtYzRjYS00:MTE2ZDk1/landscape/1536","image_path_small":"https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:ZWY5YjM3MDgtYzRjYS00:MTE2ZDk1/preview/230","credit":"Credit: Linda Rosier","caption":" Warren and Jared Bell at Bell’s Brooklyn Bagels & Bialys in Oceanside."},"pagedata":{"pagename":"what's a bialy? bell's of oceanside has been making them for 75 years - newsday:things to do:feedme","server":"newsday ace","contenttype":"specialarticle","hier":"newsday:things to do:feedme","title":"what's a bialy? bell's of oceanside has been making them for 75 years","categories":"restaurants,androidtablet","source":"newsday","contentid":"ZWQwNDNlODEtMzFlYi00","section":"feedme","contentlevel1":"things to do","contentlevel2":"feedme","contentlevel3":"feedme","contentlevel4":"feedme","setblocked":"metered","author":"erica marcus","pubdate":"2023-02-20"}},{"title":"New program could save Brookhaven residents on gas","headline":"Brookhaven residents' gas bills could drop by $100 a year under new program","summary":"The average home will see savings of about $100 annually with the implementation of a state-sponsored program designed to cut energy costs and deliver cleaner power, town officials said.","time":"","access":"restricted","paywallLabelTxt":"","paywallColor":"","paywallIcon":"","sectionLogo":"","id":"ZjVlOTcyZjYtZmYxMS00","link":"https://www.newsday.com/json/long-island/towns/brookhaven-cheaper-gas-savings-option-mzi0gu3o?device=androidtablet-4","shareLink":"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/towns/brookhaven-cheaper-gas-savings-option-mzi0gu3o","contentType":"article","byline":"By <a href=\"mailto:carl.macgowan@newsday.com, mark.harrington@newsday.com?subject=newsday.com\">Carl MacGowan and Mark Harrington</a>","sectionName":"Towns","lastUpdated":"Updated February 20, 2023 6:56 pm","newsLabel":"ONLY IN NEWSDAY","labelText":"ONLY IN NEWSDAY","labelColor":"#ab1f24","labelLogo":"","updateTag":"","sportsLink":"","body":[{"type":"text","text":"Brookhaven Town residents in May should start seeing lower natural gas bills under a state-sponsored program designed to cut energy costs and deliver cleaner power, town officials said."},{"type":"html","text":"The average home will see savings of about $100 annually with the implementation of the <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/lipa-power-community-choice-x06554\">Community Choice Aggregation program</a>, which allows municipalities to offer alternatives to standard energy suppliers.

But listen, if the fans get excited by whatever they get excited by, they’re passionate, they feel like they’re a part of something bigger than themselves, I represent the Mets. It’s not me, OK? It’s the Mets. And they’re getting excited.”"},{"type":"text","text":"Like Steinbrenner, however, Cohen’s presence looms large over his franchise, and his massive investment ($374 million plus another $100 million luxury tax) in this year’s roster figures to be a significant reason for its success. For a fan base begging to have its ownership pony up the cash for a World Series contender, Cohen is the literal answer to their prayers — while being the rest of baseball’s worst nightmare."},{"type":"text","text":"When asked what the blowback has been from his MLB brethren, Cohen said they were cordial to him at the owners’ meetings earlier this month. But it’s no coincidence that MLB has set up an economic study committee to examine the growing financial disparity between franchises, mostly due to Cohen’s lavish spending since buying the Mets three years ago."},{"type":"ad","pos":"bs2"},{"type":"text","text":"“I had owners coming up to me and going, ‘You’re 100% right,’ ” Cohen said. “ ‘You are following the rules.’ Which I am. They laid down the rules and I’m following them.”"},{"type":"text","text":"What else could they do to try to neutralize Cohen’s bold attempts to buy a World Series winner? The owners already got the players to sign off on new luxury-tax thresholds and penalties in last year’s collective bargaining agreement, including the highest one ($290M) named after Cohen himself. That was barely a speed bump for the Mets’ owner."},{"type":"text","text":"And good luck with a salary cap. There’s four more years left on this CBA, and Scott Boras would sooner settle for a hometown discount than allow the union to whisper those two words."},{"type":"text","text":"Cohen, for his part, tried to play nice when asked Monday if he would support a salary cap for baseball."},{"type":"text","text":"“I’m not going to say for now,” he said. “I would need to understand the underlying rules behind it. The answer is I’ll make that decision when we get there. But I totally sympathize with the issues in baseball. And, ultimately, I want to develop a farm system and lower our payroll to something more reasonable. I’ve always said I’m ‘bridging.’ I’m open to new ideas, but I have to understand the underlying facts.”"},{"type":"ad","pos":"bs3"},{"type":"text","text":"We don’t doubt that Cohen truly wants to build up the Mets’ organizational depth and create a talent pipeline modeled after the Dodgers’ machine-like efficiency in that area. Not only is that a way to compete using cheaper stars, but it also would allow him to use those chips to trade for game-changers that otherwise would be unavailable."},{"type":"text","text":"From what we’ve seen so far, however, it doesn’t seem as if Cohen could just go cold turkey when it comes to free agents, either. He definitely appears to enjoy the rush of his spending sprees, along with the rock-star treatment that follows. No matter how many billions he made, Cohen didn’t get on the back pages until he purchased the Mets. Now he’s a regular, and you can’t buy that kind of coverage — unless of course you’re throwing money at Verlander or Japanese ace Kodai Senga."},{"type":"text","text":"With Shohei Ohtani and Manny Machado likely on the market next offseason, Cohen is going to be first in line, checkbook in hand. And if there is any hate directed at Cohen by the envious world outside New York, or from the suites of rival owners, Mets fans will love him even more."},{"type":"text","text":"“When I do something, I don’t do it halfway,” Cohen said. “When I’m in, I’m all-in. I don’t accept mediocrity well and I have certain high expectations. If it requires me to invest in this club, then I’m going to do it.”"},{"type":"text","text":"Not that Cohen even has to say those words anymore.
